Installation Process:
---------------------

-Overview:

Briefly, the installation process involves:
a) Installing "ant" from <http://ant.apache.org> 
b) Updating the classpath in "build.xml"
c) typing "ant jar" at the command line to compile the jar file.


-In more words, the installation process:

After you unpack the sources, use "ant" <http://ant.apache.org/> to 
compile the source into java bytecode. You have to specify the classpath
before you can use "ant".
