			<h3><A name="about">ABOUT THE GAME</a></h3>
			<p>I first got hooked on the
			game of Ploy after finding a mint copy of it in the basement of a used
			bookstore in Syracuse, NY. Although simple in design, and somewhat akin
			to checkers, or oriental chess, it also has its own space-age feel about it.
			Although it is a simple two-dimensional game, I thought it would pose an
			interesting task in learning more about networking Java Applets.
			<a href="#home"><img src="../images/end10.gif" border="0"/></a></p>
	
			<p>I didn't realize [<a href="mmm.com">3M</a>]
			made games.  It looks like some of these went on
			to the Avalon-Hill company.
			[<a href="http://members.tripod.com/Larrigoni/Bookshelf.html"></a>This site</a>]
			shows the neat variety of games that
			3M had available at one point.  To a gamer who likes seeing new and different
			games, this little-known collection make you wish that part of 3M
			was still designing games.
			<a href="#home"><img src="../images/end10.gif" border="0"/></a></p>
	
			<p>Ploy has many similarities to Chess and some Chess Variants.  For instance,
			it is played on a square board with unit sized pieces, connected by lines.
			This makes it look a lot more like some Chinese versions of Chess, 
			[<a href="http://home1.gte.net/res1bup4/chess_intro.htm#board">Xianqi</a>].
			However, Ploy does not have any special zones on the board such as
			[<a href="http://homepages.wmich.edu/~h1au/history.htm">a river or
			a castle</a>].  Additionally, Ploy relies solely on 45-degree movement,
			there are no pieces which are like a knight in Ploy.

		<h3><A name="object">OBJECT OF THE GAME</a></h3>
		<p>Each player skillfully maneuvers
		the playing pieces along the paths of the playing board in an effort to
		capture the opponent's Lance, Probes, Shields or Commander. Since pieces
		can only move along paths in line with the indicators which radiate from
		their centers, the strategy for capturing - or avoiding capture - lies
		in knowing when to move in a different direction. The first player to capture
		the opponent's Commander or destroy all of the opponent's Lances, Probes and Shields,
		wins!
		<a href="#home"><img src="../images/end10.gif" border="0"/></a></p>

		<h3><A name="players">PLAYERS</a></h3>
		<p>There are either 2 or 4 players in the original game.
		<a href="#home"><img src="../images/end10.gif" border="0"/></a></p>

		<h3><A name="pieces">PIECES</a></h3>
		<p>Are they starships, or futuristic hovertanks and drone fighters?  It is up to you.
		The smooth plastic pieces are somewhere further in the future than either chess or
		checkers, but where is up to your imagination.
		<a href="#home"><img src="../images/end10.gif" border="0"/></a></p>
		
		<p>
		[<a href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/Dennis_Matheson/3m16.htm" target="_blank"
		>Ploy playing pieces</a>] are circular, domed objects like covered checkers.
		The pieces are placed on circular spaces on the board which are connected by lines.
		Each piece has one to four
		direction indicators which radiate from the center to the edge of the piece.
		These indicate - what type of piece it is, how far that piece can move per turn,
		and in what direction.
		If the piece lands upon
		an enemy piece, it must stop there and the enemy piece is destroyed.
		<a href="#home"><img src="../images/end10.gif" border="0"/></a></p>

		<p>The [<a href="../images/ploycover.jpg" target="_blank">3M Ploy Game</a>] came
		with only four choices of playing pieces: coral, green, orange, and yellow.
		The coral and green sets each included
		1 commander, 6 lances, 5 probes, and 3 shields. Not all pieces are used
		in the various games.
		<a href="#home"><img src="../images/end10.gif" border="0"/></a></p>
		
		<p>During the game, pieces must always be positioned so that their indicators line
		up with the lines on the board. Each piece may only move along the lines in the same
		direction as its indicators.  Indicators indicate forward movement only - they cannot be
		used for reverse movement unless an indicator in that direction exists on that piece.
		<a href="#home"><img src="../images/end10.gif" border="0"/></a></p>

		<h3><A name="moving">MOVING</a></h3>
		<p>Players move alternately
		by making either a <i>motion move</i> or a <i>direction move</i>.
		<a href="#home"><img src="../images/end10.gif" border="0"/></a></p>
		
		<p>A motion move consists of moving <i>one piece</i>
		over unoccupied spaces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
		in the direction of one of its indicators.
		To capture, a piece must
		move onto a space occupied by an opponent's piece; the captured piece is
		removed from the board.
		<a href="#home"><img src="../images/end10.gif" border="0"/></a></p>
		
		<p>A <i>direction move</i> consists of rotating (turning)
		one piece so that its indicators point in a different direction.
		<a href="#home"><img src="../images/end10.gif" border="0"/></a></p>
		
		<p>Example: Probe rotates so
		it can move in a different direction on another turn.
		<a href="#home"><img src="../images/end10.gif" border="0"/></a></p>
		
		<p>*** On the same turn, a Shield
		(unlike other pieces) is allowed to make a direction move <i>following</i>
		its motion move.
		<a href="#home"><img src="../images/end10.gif" border="0"/></a></p>
		
		<h3><A name="ending">ENDING THE GAME</a></h3>
		<p>Game ends when a player
		captures either his opponent's Commander <i>or </i>all of his Lances, Probes,
		and Shields.
		<a href="#home"><img src="../images/end10.gif" border="0"/></a></p>
		
		<h3><A name="versions">VERSIONS</a></h3>
		<p>There are three versions of
		game in basic Ploy: the Two-Player Game, the Four Player Free-For-All,
		and the Four Player Partnership Game.
		<a href="#home"><img src="../images/end10.gif" border="0"/></a></p>
		
		<h3>TWO PLAYER GAME</h3>
		<p>Players use only two color sets of pieces.</p>

		<h3>FOUR PLAYER FREE-FOR-ALL GAME</h3>
		<p>In the free-for-all game, each player has 1 Commander,
		2 Lances, 3 Probes, and 3 Shields.
		<a href="#home"><img src="../images/end10.gif" border="0"/></a></p>
		
		<p>When a player's Commander
		is captured, he is out of the game; the remainder of his pieces may be
		used by the capturing player on subsequent turns. (If a player captures
		the Commander of a player who has been using a previously-defeated player's
		pieces, the capturing player takes control of any remaining pieces of both
		defeated players.) When all of a player's Lance, Probes, and Shields have
		been captured, the Commander is removed from the board and that player
		is out of the game. When all opponents have been defeated, the remaining
		player is the winner.

		<h3>FOUR PLAYER PARTNERSHIP GAME</h3>
		<p>In the four-player partnership
		game, each player has 1 Commander,
		2 Lances, 3 Probes, and 3 Shields.
		<a href="#home"><img src="../images/end10.gif" border="0"/></a></p>
		
		<p>Partners share one side of
		the board (top or bottom) and move their pieces in individual turns. During
		his turn, each player makes either a motion move <i>or</i> a direction
		move in the usual manner.
		<a href="#home"><img src="../images/end10.gif" border="0"/></a></p>
		
		<p>Game ends when one partnership
		captures both Commanders <i>or </i>all Lances, Probes and Shields <i>or
		</i>one
		opponent's Commander and all of his partner's Lances, Probes, and Shields.
		<a href="#home"><img src="../images/end10.gif" border="0"/></a></p>
		
		<p>A Player may continue to
		play as long as he has pieces on the board if his partner has a Commander
		and at least one other piece on the board. A player whose pieces have all
		been captured is out of the game. His partner continues to play, alternating
		turns with opponents. (Thus, if Player A were eliminated, play would continue
		with Player B, then Player C, Player D, Player B, Player C, etc.).
